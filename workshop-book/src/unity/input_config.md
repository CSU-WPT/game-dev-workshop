### Input Configuration

- For this tutorial, we will be using the new Unity Input system.
- Those w/ prior Unity experience may still know how inputs were taken from the user before the addition of the new system (done mostly within code)

<br/>

- However, with the new system, we can easily configure different actions for our player asset with custom made action maps and key bindings (you can even configure controllers!)


##### Let's get started!

<br/>

1. Navigate out of the assets folder (if you're following along from the previous page).

2. Right-click, hover over *Create* and scroll down until you see *Input Actions*. Click it to create a new Input Actions Asset. 
    - I named mine "Player_Control" but you can name it whatever you want.

3. On the right, click *Assign as the Project-wide Input Actions*. This ensures that our inputs stay consistent and that we don't run into any unexpected errors.

<br/>

Now, double-click to open it in a separate window and dock it next to the *Scene* and *Game* view.
